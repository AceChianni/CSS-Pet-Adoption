# CSS-Pet-Adoption

I created the landing page for a Pet Adoption website and developed a gallery page using flexbox, incorporating some CSS and keyframe animations. 
Utilizing CSS Grid I created a dashboard page that featured various sections including new arrivals, and will uses grid template areas for an organized layout.
